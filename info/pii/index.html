  <h3>Be careful about your PII</h3>

  <p>Even seemingly insignificant pieces of PII (personal information)
    can be used to identify you. If you leave an anonymous comment saying
    that you drive a red Honda, it's not enough to identify you. However
    in another comment you mention that you're 45, then 3 months later you
    say that you work for a small retailer store. Someone can put all this together,
    look at when you usually post comments to determine your timezone and
    then make a good guess who you are. Fragmentation of information is your
    friend. If you've slipped too much PII, change accounts and make it difficult
    to build your profile.</p>
